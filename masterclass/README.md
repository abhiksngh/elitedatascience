# Machine-Learning-Masterclass
EliteDataScience's Machine Learning Masterclass course. 

Learned and honed skills with EliteDataScienceâ€™s guided Machine
Learning Masterclass. Built four project portfolios using Python while
learning the most popular ML techniques to build models. I also learned
about the data science workflow of data exploration, cleaning, and
feature engineering and model training.

Much of the credit goes to the Elite Data Science group at
https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-masterclass for their
supplementary code from their modules.
